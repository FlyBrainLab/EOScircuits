"""Antennal Lobe Circuit

This module supports:

1. Changing parameter values of Biological Spike Generators (BSGs) associated with each of the Local and Projection Neurons,
2. Changing the number and connectivity of Projection Neurons innervating a given AL Glomerulus,
3. Changing the number and connectivity of Local Neurons in the Predictive Coding and ON-OFF circuits of the AL
